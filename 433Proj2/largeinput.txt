In this assignment you shall gain hands-on knowledge with DES and RSA algorithms covered
in class, by implementing an application which encrypts files. You shall not be implement-
ing your own DES and RSA algorithms. Instead, you shall be using the DES and RSA
encryption functions provided by the openssl library. you may work in groups of 6
File assig2skeleton.zip provides the skeleton codes. The skeleton codes comprise the Makefile
and most importantly, the DES class. The DES class, similar to the classical ciphers you imple-
mented in Assignment 1, also implements CipherInterface interface. The job of DES class is
to encrypt/decrypt data using the DES algorithm. The class contains 3 functions setKey(),
encrypt(), and decrypt(). The functions perform the following tasks:
